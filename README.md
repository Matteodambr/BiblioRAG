# BiblioRAG
BiblioRAG is a python wrapper to handle high-accuracy retrieval augmented generation (RAG) from your Mendeley library. This repo is built on top of the Mendeley API and on Paper-QA2, to automatically retrieve your reference lists, and perform RAG actions on them, such as question answering, summarization, and contradiction detection.
